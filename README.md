## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to predict the future sale price of a bulldozer given its characteristics and historical sales data. This is a regression problem as we are predicting a numerical value. The techniques and methodologies used in this project are inspired by the [fast.ai machine learning course](https://course18.fast.ai/ml).

## Problem Definition

How well can we predict the future sale price of a bulldozer, given its characteristics and previous examples of how much similar bulldozers have been sold for?

## Data

The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data). It is a time series dataset containing historical sales data of bulldozers. The dataset consists of the following files:
1. **Train.csv**: Historical sales data up to 2011.
2. **Valid.csv**: Sales data from January 1, 2012, to April 30, 2012.
3. **Test.csv**: Sales data from May 1, 2012, onwards.

## Evaluation Metric

The primary evaluation metric for this project is the **Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE)**. This metric is used to measure the differences between predicted and actual values.

## Results

By following the steps outlined in the notebook, you'll be able to train a machine learning model capable of predicting bulldozer sale prices. The model's performance will be assessed using the RMSLE (Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error) metric.
